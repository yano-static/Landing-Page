            As you grow older, you grow more and more tiresome of things, making you prone to burnout.
            It’s something that you won’t be able to avoid, unless you can dodge a bullet.
            Now that you can’t avoid it, you can only cope, or do your best to deal with it.
            But why is burnout so inevitable?

          <p class="post-excerpt">
            Living in a toxic household, where emotions are kept, apologies are turned into favors,
            where grades meant everything. This type of environment has been building my personality:
            from bursting into breakdowns because of bottled emotions, to escaping every problem I can’t
            handle by avoiding it. Every child has experienced this type of growth; however, it can be
            different for each one.
          </p>
          <p class="post-excerpt">
            For me, every factor of that—and if you include problems from outside your home—you are only
            human to get tired of it. You get tired of hiding everything you feel, grow tired of having to
            live up to their expectations. As I grow tired, I try lessening their expectations.
            As much as I want to make people proud, I can’t make everyone be proud of me. I can only be so
            much, but I can be more if I’m allowed to grow on my own.
          </p>
          <p class="post-excerpt">
            Regardless of everything I said, notice how they were thoughts, how it was only just something
            that I’ve thought ahead. Not really my imagination, rather, a product of overthinking.
            The reason I get burnout, the reason I get tired of everything, is because of things that have
            not yet happened. May it be mental or spiritual, that doesn’t mean you’re wrong for feeling that
            way.
          </p>
          <p class="post-excerpt">
            Now that you know what burns you out, how do we deal with it? Go out, have fun.
            Everything that’s in your head—clear it out with good and better memories. Won’t you rather have
            memories of fun with friends than a breakup? And have fun with other activities, instead of
            hurting yourself over a low grade. It happened already; what matters most is what happens next, so,
            look ahead.

          <p class="post-excerpt">
            Now that the bad things went by, now that you’ve been through a lot, it will make you stronger.
            It will help you deal with things a lot better, be more patient, and be an overall better person—
            as long as you take care of yourself. You’ll be fine.
